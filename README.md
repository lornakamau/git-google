# GitGoogle
#### A Github finder that allows users to search for Github users by username and Github repositories by reponame , 17/05/2020.
#### By Lorna Kamau

## Description
On the application's landing page, we have a navigation bar and a brief definition of what the application is about. By clicking on the arrows at the bottom of the landing page, one is able to view the developer's github profile. Clicking on the 'Find a user' button displays an input field where one enters the username they wish to search. Similarly for the 'Find a repo' button. The search results then display relevant information on the Github user and Github repository respectively.
